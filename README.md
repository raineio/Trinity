# Trinity
Piece of concept wrapper library for C++ Final Fantasy XIV plugins

## What *is* Trinity?

All Trinity is designed to do, is provide an API to abstract .NET 5 C# methods and functionality into C++ stubs you can use with your own mods,
allowing for native mods in FFXIV.

## Why `Trinity`?

I had the name suggested to me by a friend, explaining it was the one of the codenames of the many Xbox 360 motherboards during its development, and it kinda stuck with me.
