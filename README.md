# Trinity
POC wrapper library for C++ Final Fantasy XIV plugins

## What *is* Trinity?

All Trinity is designed to do, is provide an API to abstract .NET 5 C# methods and functionality into C++ stubs you can use with your own mods,
allowing for native mods in FFXIV.

## Why `Trinity`?

I had the name suggested to me by a friend, explaining it was the one of the codenames of the many Xbox 360 motherboards during its development, and it kinda stuck with me.

## What languages will be usable?

Current plan includes C++ only, but I will accept Pull Requests for language integrations, so long they're not horrible, hard to use or just plain slow. (Looking at you Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.) I will review and assess the viability. Keep in mind, this is only going to be available when I get C# -> C++ working.
